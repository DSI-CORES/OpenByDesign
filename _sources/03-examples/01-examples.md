# Open Science Examples

Welcome to the examples section of the handbook! This section is organized by scientific disciplines. We are actively collecting research projects that have implemented open science practices. Please feel free to open a pull request to include your work here. There are no restrictions on what can be added. We are seeking to share a diverse set of open science research projects.

For guidance on opening a pull request, please refer to our [contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) or ask Franklin (GitHub: @franklin-feingold, Email: ffein@stanford.edu). Please feel free to ask Franklin any other questions you may have!

## Social science

#### [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/)

The Stanford Open Policing Project collects, standardizes, and publicly shares data on vehicle and pedestrian stops from law enforcement departments across the country. They have gathered over 200 million records from dozens of state and local police departments across the country.

-   Open science components: data sharing, code sharing, reproducible data analysis
-   Data: [Project website](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/)
-   Code and data analysis: [GitHub](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/opp). The reproducible data analysis can be found on their [GitHub](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/opp) by looking at their [README](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/opp/blob/master/README.md).
