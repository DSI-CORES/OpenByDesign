# Practical guide to getting started

The purpose of this guide is to briefly introduce and orient you to navigate our GitHub organization and submit your contribution. Our intention is to keep this short, sweet, and to the point. We have provided links to more verbose descriptions. Please open an issue if there are other fundamental terms that would be beneficial to add here.

## GitHub navigation

### Organization vs Repository

A [GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) is typically where the development occurs. Common repository tasks are opening issues or pull requests. While, a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations) consists of one or more repositores. 

In our case, this repository is named: `OpenByDesign` under the `DSI-CORES` organization.


Organizations are useful for managing a collection of related repositories. One advantage of keeping repositories together is the ability to manage them all from one place. A common management task is giving additional permissions to specific users or teams.

### Teams

An organization can establish several [teams](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams). Teams can be given additional permissions over organization repositories and they have their own project and discussion boards. Teams can be found from the [organization's main page](https://github.com/DSI-CORES). 

In our organization, we utilize teams for managing our working groups. These teams are broken down by subject area. Please feel free to request to join any team that fits your interests!

### Projects

[Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/) are a convenient way to signal to the community what issues need to be resolved before a particular milestone is reached (e.g. new release or completion of a chapter).

Projects can be created within a repository or team. 

## Adding Content

### Forking

[Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) is copying the repository into your workspace (personal account). This enables you to begin working on your contributions. 

### Branching

[Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches) are a useful way of managing different contributions. We suggest focusing a branch on addressing a specific issue/purpose. This can be adding an example or section of a chapter. Keeping the branch focused will make the pull request more managable to review and accept. We recommend *not* working on the `master` branch. Rather, work on a branch of `master`. A repository can have several branches.

### Pull request

[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are the primary way enhancements are incorporated into the handbook. Please refer to our [contributing guide](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#4-submit-a-pull-request) when submitting a pull request.
