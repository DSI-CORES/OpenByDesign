# Open Science Examples

Welcome to the examples section of the handbook! This section is organized by scientific disciplines. We are actively collecting research projects that have implemented open science practices. Please feel free to open a pull request to include your work here. There are no restrictions on what can be added. We are seeking to share a diverse set of open science research projects.

For guidance on opening a pull request, please refer to our [contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) or ask Franklin (GitHub: @franklin-feingold, Email: ffein@stanford.edu). Please feel free to ask Franklin any other questions you may have!
