# Collaborating with GitHub

GitHub is a popular hosting service for the distributed version control system Git. The advantages of using GitHub are that it:
- Offers free accounts (unlimited public and private repositories)
- Gives you a public portfolio of your code and projects
- Provides a backup of your project on remote servers
- Easily allows you to distribute open source code and software
- Fosters streamlined collaboration for development of code and software

GitHub is known as a hub for software development and distribution because of its robust infrastructure for collaborative contribution. Through a GitHub profile, a team can create a remote repository of a project that exists on GitHub servers.

The members of a team, called collaborators, are given permissions to make direct changes to the remote project repository. Each collaborator will **clone**, or create a copy of, the full project from the remote repository onto their local machine (called a local repository). When a collaborator makes a change, they will create a **commit**, or snapshot, of the change and **push** and **merge** this change from their local repository to the remote repository of the project. Once a change is pushed to the remote repository, all collaborators will be able to see this change in the remote repository. In order to port changes from the remote to local repositories, collaborators can **pull** the latest remote copy of the project. 

Collaborators can communicate to each other through the following:
- **Issues**: notes about tasks, additions, bugs, feedback
- **Pull request**: make changes to a repository, comment on suggested changes
- **GitHub Discussions**: forum for conversations, announcements

Individuals who are not members of the team but who would like to contribute to a project are called contributors. Contributors to a project can communicate with the team through **issues**, make their own copy of or **fork** the project that they want to contribute to, make or “push” changes to the project, and submit a **pull request** to present the suggested changes to the project team.

This is a simplified introduction to collaborating with GitHub. GitHub has thoroughly documented everything from initializing a repository to contributing to projects and communicating on GitHub. Please follow [this Quick Start guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) for more detailed information.
