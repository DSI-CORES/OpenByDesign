# Computer literacy

## File systems

-   Need to understand the concept of how files are organized on a computer file system. Important concepts include:
    -   What is a file path?  What is the difference between a relative and an absolute path?
    -   What does “case sensitive” mean?

## Files

-   Need to understand the different types of files that can exist on a computer, and how to work with them. Important concepts include:
    -   Text vs. binary files
    -   Different types of text files (e.g. comma-separated vs tab-separated)

## Command line

-   Need to understand how to access the command line interface on one’s computer and how to use it to perform operations. Important concepts include:
    -   Moving around the file system
    -   Working with files and directories (creating, removing, moving)

## Editing text files

-   It is very useful to know how to edit text files from the command line.
-   All of these require learning of somewhat unintuitive key combinations for various operations, so it’s useful to keep a cheat sheet handy
-   On UNIX-like systems (Mac OS, Linux) popular alternatives include:
