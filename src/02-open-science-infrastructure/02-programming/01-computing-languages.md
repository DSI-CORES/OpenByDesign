# Computing/Programming languages

## Python
[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a popular programming language that is used for a diversity of applications, from data parsing to software development. Its simplified syntax makes it accessible to beginners and experienced programmers alike. Due to its extensive toolbox for data analysis, it is often referred to as a "scientific programming language".

[python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) defines Python as: 
> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
 
To break that down...
- **Interpreted**: step-by-step execution of source code by an interpreter at runtime
- **Object-oriented**: designed around storing data, and attributes and behavior of the data, in objects
- **High-level**: more human-readable, less machine-readable 
- **Dynamic**: data types of variables are not declared and are not checked before runtime

## R
[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a programming language and environment that is widely used within the scientific community for statistical analysis and data visualization applications. It was based on the statistical programming language S to serve as an open-source alternative. R supports an extensive suite of packages developed and documented by users to accomplish a range of statistical and scientific analyses. R programmers often interface with R in the open-source integrated development environment [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which offers tools for plot visualization, debugging, and workspace management.
