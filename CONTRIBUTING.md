# Contributing to Open By Design

**Welcome to Open By Design repository!** 

_We're so excited you're here and want to contribute._

**We want to ensure that every user and contributor feels welcome and included in the Open By Design community**.

We hope that this guideline document will make it as easy as possible for you to get involved.

We welcome all contributions to this project via GitHub issues and pull requests.
Please follow these guidelines to make sure your contributions can be easily integrated in the projects.
As you start contributing to Open By Design, don't forget that your ideas are more important than perfect pull requests. :heart:

If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know through one of the many ways to [get in touch](#get-in-touch).

## Joining the community

Open By Design is a community-oriented and -led project.
We therefore require that all our members and their contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md)**.
Please familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) that lists the expected behaviours and our reporting guidelines.

## Inclusivity

_Open By Design_ aims to be inclusive to people from all walks of life and to all research fields.
These intentions must be reflected in the contributions that we make to the project.

In addition to the Code of Conduct, we encourage intentional inclusive actions from contributors to _Open By Design_.
Here are a few examples of such actions:

- When appropriate, refer to "open scholarship" rather than only "open science" so that we do not exclude members of the arts and humanities from our community.
- Make sure colour palettes are accessible to colour-blind readers and contributors.
  Here's a useful blog post on [tips for designing scientific figures for color blind readers](http://www.somersault1824.com/tips-for-designing-scientific-figures-for-color-blind-readers) by Luk at [Somersault 1824](http://www.somersault1824.com).

## Get in touch

There are many ways to get in touch with Open By Design team!

- Join our Slack channel
  - This is our preferred method of open communication and discussion!
    We'd love for you to swing by to say hello.

- You can contact the Community Manager of _Open By Design_ project - Franklin Feingold - by email at [ffein@stanford.edu](mailto:ffein@stanford.edu).

## Contributing through GitHub

[Git][git] is a really useful tool for version control. [GitHub][github] sits on top of Git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using Git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past, but Open By Design maintainers are here to help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter! :heart:

In order to contribute via GitHub you'll need to set up a free account and sign in.
Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going.
Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to along the way.

## Writing in Markdown

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown][markdown].
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting.
For example you could write words as **bold** (`**bold**`), or in _italics_ (`_italics_`), or as a [link][rick-roll] (`[link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

Also when writing in Markdown, please start each new sentence on a new line.
While this formats in the same way as if the new line wasn't included, it makes the [diffs produced during the pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests) review easier to read! :sparkles:


## Where to start: issues

Before you open a new issue, please check if any of our [open issues](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/issues) covers your idea already.
If you open a new issue, please follow our basic guidelines laid out in our [issue templates](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/issues/new/choose).
There are 3 issues templates to choose from.:
1. New Chapter Template ([preview here](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/issues/new?assignees=&template=CHAPTER_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)):  This issue is a place to discuss matters relating to the writing a new chapter on a new topic or adding a subchapter in an already existing chapter.
2. General ([preview here](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/issues/new?assignees=&template=ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)):  Use this template for a general issue related to the book, community, process or ideas.
3. Bug Report ([preview here](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D)): With this template, create an issue report that can help others repair something that is currently broken.
This can be used for reporting errors like typos and broken links.
The issue template will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new issue page, so all you need to do is edit the "_Lorem ipsum_" sections.

## Making a change with a pull request

We appreciate all contributions to Open By Design.
**THANK YOU** for helping us build this useful resource. :sparkles::star2::dizzy:

All project management, conversations and questions related to Open By Design project happens here in the [OpenByDesign repository][open-by-design-repo].
This is also where you can contribute directly to writing or editing chapters of [the book](book-url)!

The following steps are a guide to help you contribute in a way that will be easy for everyone to review and accept with ease :sunglasses:.

### 1. Comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/issues) or open a new issue referencing your addition

This allows other members of Open By Design team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

Remember, if you open a new issue, please follow our basic guidelines laid out in our [issue template](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
The issue template will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new issue page so all you need to do is edit the "_Lorem ipsum_" sections.

### 2. [Fork][github-fork] the [Open By Design repository][open-by-design-repo] to your profile

This is now your own unique copy of Open By Design.
Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][github-syncfork] with the master repository, otherwise you can end up with lots of dreaded [merge conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].
If you prefer working in the browser, [these instructions](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) describe how to sync your fork to the original repository via GitHub.

### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused.
If you submit a large amount of work all in one go it will be much more work for whomever is reviewing your pull request.
[Help them help you.][jerry-maguire] :wink:

While making your changes, commit often and write good, detailed commit messages.
[This blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) explains how to write a good Git commit message and why it matters.
It is also perfectly fine to have a lot of commits - including ones that break code.
A good rule of thumb is to push up to GitHub when you _do_ have passing tests then the continuous integration (CI) has a good chance of passing everything. 😸

If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new branch][github-branches] and a [new issue][open-by-design-issues] to go with it. [This blog](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) details the different Git branching models.

Please do not re-write history!
That is, please do not use the [rebase](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-git-rebase) command to edit previous commit messages, combine multiple commits into one, or delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary.

Are you new to Git and GitHub or just want a detailed guide on getting started with version control? Check out our [Using Version Control chapter](TBD) in the Open By Design Book!

### 4. Submit a [pull request][github-pullrequest]

We encourage you to open a pull request as early in your contributing process as possible.
This allows everyone to see what is currently being worked on.
It also provides you, the contributor, feedback in real time from both the community and the continuous integration as you make commits (which will help prevent stuff from breaking).

When you are ready to submit a pull request, you will automatically see the [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) contents in the pull request body.
It asks you to:

- Describe the problem you're trying to fix in the pull request, reference any related issue and use fixes/close to automatically close them, if pertinent.
- List of changes proposed in the pull request.
- Describe what the reviewer should concentrate their feedback on.

By filling out the "_Lorem ipsum_" sections of the pull request template with as much detail as possible, you will make it really easy for someone to review your contribution!

If you have opened the pull request early and know that its contents are not ready for review or to be merged, add "[WIP]" at the start of the pull request title, which stands for "Work in Progress".
When you are happy with it and are happy for it to be merged into the main repository, change the "[WIP]" in the title of the pull request to "[Ready for review]".

A member of Open By Design team will then review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main repository.
A [review][github-review] will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you've done.
Keep an eye on your GitHub notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your [fork][github-fork] of Open By Design [repository][open-by-design-repo] and the pull request will automatically update with those changes.
You don't need to submit a new pull request when you make a change in response to a review.

You can also submit pull requests to other contributors' branches!
Do you see an [open pull request](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/pulls) that you find interesting and want to contribute to?
Simply make your edits on their files and open a pull request to their branch!

What happens if the continuous integration (CI) fails (for example, if the pull request notifies you that "Some checks were not successful")?
The CI could fail for a number of reasons.
At the bottom of the pull request, where it says whether your build passed or failed, you can click “Details” next to the test, which takes you to the Github Actions page.
You can learn more about Github Actions in the [Continuous Integration chapter](TBD) of the book!

GitHub has a [nice introduction][github-flow] to the pull request workflow, but please [get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you have any questions :balloon:.

### Syncing your fork

You may find your fork becomes out of sync with this repository. This can be from other contributors submitting their changes. It is *strongly recommended* to sync your fork prior to committing your changes. We have described two ways to do this.

#### GitHub web interface

To begin, please navigate to your fork of the repository. You will find a box informing you that your fork is a number of commits behind master. Please click on the `compare` button. This will bring you to the compare changes page. This enables us to stage our pull request.

![compare-picture](sync-fork/compare_picture.png "compare-picture")

Upon navigating to this screen, you will likely see something very similar to the picture below. To remedy this, please ensure you are pulling commits from the master branch into your fork. This can be done by switching the base.

![initial-compare](sync-fork/initial-compare.png "initial-compare")

Once your fork is selected as the base, you will see the commits your pull request seeks to merge into your fork. Please click on the `Create pull request` button.

![compare-pr](sync-fork/compare-pr.png "compare-pr")

This will navigate you to finish filling out your pull request. Please enter a title and `Create the pull request`. Once it has been created please `merge` it. As the pull request is merged, your repository will be brough back in sync with the master branch - you are ready to begin adding in your contributions!

#### Command line

To begin, please make sure you have a copy of your fork on your local disk. This can be done by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced). The result of this guide is: you have your fork downloaded locally with the remotes set up. 

The following commands presume you are in your fork's directory with upstream configured as `git@github.com:DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign.git`

To pull in the changes from master please enter:

```
git pull upstream master
```

Now your local copy is synced with the master branch. To push these changes to your fork's master branch please enter: 

```
git push origin master
```

To check if this syncronization worked, please navigate to your fork on the web interface. Please look directly above the directory rendering for the banner conveying `This branch is even with OpenByDesign:master`.

If you have any questions about this process please feel free to reach out to Franklin (email: ffein@stanford.edu, GitHub: franklin-feingold)

## The process of writing chapters

- Fork the repository from the DSI-CORES version if you have not done so already.
- On the DSI-CORES version create a branch with the same name as the chapter to be written.
- On your fork create a branch with the same name and create a markdown file on it.
- Copy the chapter template in the templates directory into the markdown file, and commit.
- Make a pull request to the DSI-CORES version of the chapter branch.
  The title of this request should have the form "[WIP] Write Chapter_name chapter".
  WIP indicates the chapter is a Work In Progress and not yet ready for review.
- On your branch add material to the chapter and commit.
  The goal of this project is to collate and build on the many good resources already available about good practise in data science.
  As such this material should primarily be drawn from outside sources.
  Note the link and (if available) license of the source.
- Once a significant amount of material has been amassed, work (preferably with others) to develop a chapter outline.
- Edit the amassed material into a coherent chapter, adding more material if gaps become apparent.
- Edit the chapter for style.
- Once the first draft of the chapter is complete change [WIP] in the pull request title to [Ready for review].
- Add a comment on the pull request indicating that this chapter is ready for high level review, i.e discussion of changes of scale of a paragraph or larger such as adding material and restructuring sections.
- Discuss and make these high level changes on this pull request. Once this is complete merge the chapter into the alan turing intitute's version of the chapter branch.
- Make another pull request from your fork's version of the branch to the alan turing institute's version of the branch. Title this "[Ready for review] Chapter_name chapter- low level reviews".
- Discuss and make low level changes to the chapter on this pull request, such as rewording sentences, typos and the like.
- This division of the pull requests into high and low level changes stops discussion threads becoming unmanagably long.
- Once this is complete merge the pull request into the DSI-CORES version of the chapter branch.
- Merge the alan turing intitute's version of the chapter branch into the DSI-CORES master branch.
- DO not delete the branch as the chapter may continue to undergo improvement and development in the future.

## Local development

You can build and host the book website locally. The steps are:

### To build book locally

1. Install the required software to build the book, optionally in a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments):

   ```
   pip install -r book/website/requirements.txt
   ```

2. You can now build or refresh the book using:

   ```
   cd ./book/website
   jupyter-book build .
   ```

## Style Guide


### Writing style

To ensure all text can be read easily by all (including screen readers and non-native english speakers), follow Gov.uk guidance on e.g., i.e., and etc. (1)
That is, do not use them:

eg can sometimes be read aloud as ‘egg’ by screen reading software. Instead use ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’ - whichever works best in the specific context.

etc can usually be avoided.
Try using ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’.
Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words.

ie - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood.
Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as ‘meaning’ or ‘that is’.

1. https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#eg-etc-and-ie

### Sentences

When writing all sentences should go on a new line.
This will make no difference to how the text is displayed, there will still be paragraphs, but it will mean that any pull requests will be easier to check; the changes will be on a single line instead of somewhere in a paragraph. Consider the example below.

 ```
Today you are you, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is youer than you. - Dr Seuss
```

 A pull request on this correcting it to have a ‘.’ after Dr would show as a change to the whole paragraph.
Contrast this with the next example which will be displayed online in the exact same way, but would see a change to a single line.

 ```
Today you are you, that is truer than true.
There is no one alive who is youer than you.
- Dr Seuss
```

### Opinions

Open By Design book is intended to be only lightly opinionated.
Whilst more opinionated content is allowed, such content should be clearly marked.
The best way to do this is by displaying it in a quote box.
This can be done by either prefixing every line with the greater than symbol `>`.
Note, that the formatting will be retained, so we can split each sentence to a new line as recommended before.

```
> I will not eat them in a house,
> i will not eat them with a mouse,
> i will not eat them in a box i will not eat them with a fox,
> i will not eat them here of there i will not eat them anywhere,
> I do not like green eggs and ham i do not like them sam i am
```

### Figures

To make things look cleaner, it is advised that all figures be encapsulated in a table with a caption.
This can be done simply as:

```
| ![A dish with Green Eggs and Ham](/figures/green_eggs_ham.jpg)         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Try them, try them, and you may! Try them and you may, I say.  |
```

Figures should be added to the `book/content/figures` directory.


### Auto-formatting

The Github Actions continuous-integration tests will check for formatting errors using [prettier.io](https://prettier.io). You can see a list of all files with style issues by looking at the Github Actions logs, for example:

```
Checking formatting...
book/content/introduction/introduction.md
book/content/open_research/open_research.md
Code style issues found in the above file(s). Forgot to run Prettier?
The command "prettier --check ./book/content/**/*.md" exited with 1.
```

*Optional:* If you would like to apply auto-formatting when editing locally, we recommend [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To get started, run the following from your shell:

```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Each time you attempt to commit a change with git, pre-commit will run the prettier auto-formatter and automagically fix any style issues.



### Referencing and Citing

We maintain a centralised [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) file containing all references.
The file is located within this repository in the file `./book/website/_bibliography/references.bib`.

#### Adding a new reference

To include a citation in your content, follow the guide for [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/content/citations.html).

The key concepts are:

- Include a reference using {cite}`CITEKEY`, where `CITEKEY` is the corresponding citation key in `references.bib`
- You can also include multiple citations in one go by separating the CITEKEYs by a comma: {cite}`CITEKEY1,CITEKEY2,CITEKEY3`
- Add a bibliography entry at the end of your file use the following directive under a reference header:

```{bibliography} ../_bibliography/references.bib
```

This will generate a bibliography for all the files you have referenced in your file.
Please note that you will need to edit the relative path (`../_bibliography/references.bib`) of the `references.bib` based on the location of file you edit.

#### Adding a new reference in `references.bib`

You can edit references locally using a method from the following:

- Edit `references.bib` directly using a text editor
- Edit `references.bib` directly using a managing program such as [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/) (linux, windows, macOS) or [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/) (macOS)

For example, say we have an entry in the `references.bib` file as:

```
@article{Kuula2010archiving,
	Author = {Kuula, Arja},
	Date-Added = {2019-05-28 17:47:46 +0100},
	Date-Modified = {2019-05-30 8:57:26 am +0100},
	Journal = {IASSIST Quarterly},
	Number = {3-4},
	Pages = {35},
	Title = {Methodological and Ethical Dilemmas of Archiving Qualitative Data},
	Url = {http://www.iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/iqvol34_35_kuula.pdf},
	Volume = {34},
	Year = {2010}}
```

We could cite this article in the book using {cite}`Kuula2010archiving`.

#### Citation key style-guide

We recommend using the following structure for citation keys:

```
AuthorYYYYword
```
Where:
1. `Author` is the surname of the first author (`Kuula` above)
2. `YYYY` is the year (`2010` above)
3. `word` is the first meaningful word in the title (`archiving` above). Note, this is subjective – choose a name that makes it easy to remember the reference when you see the citation key.

### Cross-referencing chapters

When editing the files (in Markdown format), you can create hyperlinked text by writing texts inside square brackets '[]' followed by inserting the file path (URL) inside the round brackets, '()'.
For example, `[Open By Design Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com)` will appear as [Open By Design Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com).

To link between different pages within the book, you can use relative paths of the files.
For example, to cross-reference the "Open Research" chapter in the "Version Control" Chapter (both are in the 'Reproducibile Research' section of the book), instead of writing `[Open Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/reproducible-research/open-research/open-research.html)` you will add the relative link as `[Open Research](../open-research/open-research)`.

Similarly, you can cross reference one chapter from one section to another chapter in another section.

For example, cross referencing the subchapter 'reproducible-research/version-control/vcs-github' (in the 'Reproducible Research' section) chapter in the 'collaboration/github-collaboration/github-collaboration' (in the 'Collaboration' section), we can use the following directive:

```
> Learn more about [Git commands for GitHub](../../reproducible-research/version-control/vcs-github)
```

The path you add _starts_ from the [`website`](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/tree/master/book/website) folder in this GitHub repository.
Note the difference between starting your path with `/`, which means it will start from the `website` folder vs starting from the location of the file you're writing in.

A nice easy way to find absolute path can be found by looking at the page you would like to link to (for example, https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/welcome.html) and then taking everything after https://the-turing-way.netlify.com.
Please note that you do not need to include the file extension, for example .html, in your relative path.

#### Using labels for cross referencing sections of a chapter

We recommend using the cross-referencing style as described in the [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/content/citations.html) for cross referencing sections of different chapters.
Labels are a way to add tags to parts of your content that you can reference later on.
This is helpful if you want to quickly insert links to other parts of your book.

To add a label, use the following pattern before the element you wish to label:
```
(my-label-name)=
# The thing that I want to label
```
You can insert cross-references to labels in your file with the following syntax: {ref}`my-label-name`.


## Representing Open By Design

We would LOVE people to give talks about the project or represent Open By Design in other ways! 

If you would like to do that please open an issue and ping @franklin-feingold so
that they can do their best to support you.

We would appreciate if you could share your slides by adding them to the
[conferences folder](/conferences) and some info in the [conferences README.md](/conferences/README.md).



## Recognising Contributions

Open By Design follows the [all-contributors][all-contributors] specification, so we welcome and recognise all contributions from documentation to testing to writing chapters.
You can see a list of current contributors [here](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/blob/master/contributors.md). 😍

The all-contributors bot usage is described [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).
To add yourself or someone else as a contributor, comment on the relevant Issue or Pull Request with the following:

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>
```

You can see the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid `<contribution>` types and examples of how we've run this command in [this issue](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/issues/274).
The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor and reply with the pull request details.

**PLEASE NOTE: Only one contributor can be added with the bot at a time!**
Add each contributor in turn, merge the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`) before adding another one.
Otherwise, you can end up with dreaded [merge conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].
Therefore, please check the [open pull requests](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/pulls) first to make sure there aren't any open requests from the bot before adding another.

What happens if you accidentally run the bot before the previous run was merged and you got those pesky merge conflicts?
(Don't feel bad, we have all done it! 🙈)
Simply close the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`).
If you are unable to do this for any reason, please let us know in the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) or by opening an issue, and a Turing Way team member will be very happy to help!

Finally, don't forget to add yourself to the list of contributors [here](https://github.com/DSI-CORES/OpenByDesign/blob/master/contributors.md)!
